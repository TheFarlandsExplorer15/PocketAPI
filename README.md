# PocketAPI
Adds the API for Minecraft Pocket Edition in Minecraft Java Edition.
This does not work well yet.
Please go to issue tracker to find The POCKETAPI bug tracker.
This is not my fault that there is an error in java.exception.minecraft.class.a(java.367)
java.exception.minecraft.class.b(java.571)
and so on.
This project is in it's early betas (switch to PRE tag to get the pre-updates.
Please add this as a MULTIMC instance for MULTIMC 5 v0.7.0_3741 or as an BetaCraft mod for BetaCraft v1.0.16_01.
If there is an error than please launch the .launch, the .launcher, the .jar, the .exe, the .bat, the .javarun, and the .tar.gz files.
I can not help if there is an error until it is fixed.
This API is in VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT, SO WE CAN NOT HELP YOU YET WITH MOST BUGS.
How to do:
1. install the .zip or .jar file.
2. run the application of .launch, .launcher, .jar, .exe, .bat, .javarun, .tar.gz files above.
3. please replace java with openJDK-21-ea-15.
4. use 7-zip or other file viewers to see whats wrong.
5. have fun!!!
These steps are the most important ones, so please check my youtube channel, my reddit community, my mediafire .logs, and my comments on youtube.
